## Dataset
The project uses the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset:
- tmdb_5000_movies.csv
- tmdb_5000_credits.csv

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Similarity calculation using cosine similarity

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells in order.
3. Enter a movie title when prompted to receive recommendations.

## Output
